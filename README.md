# Dragon-Slayer
A text based video game.

A strange wizard has transported you to a dungeon and given you a sword can you escape?


Dungeon design:
The dungeon is a grid of rooms each with 4 sides, to make things easier for the programers, umm or Wizard.... 

A room can have as many as 4 door, one on each wall. Some doors lock behind you so you can't go back through them once you enter the next room, some doors are locked and require a special key to open. One of the rooms will have an exit which will allow you to escape the dungeon and win the game, or if the programmers feel ambitious move to the next level of the game. You may have to battle a dragon to exit the dungeon or maybe the Wizard will let you off easy.
